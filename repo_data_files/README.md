## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare data:
```bash
python data/preprocess.py
```

## Training

To train a specific model:

```bash
python train.py --model [model_name]
```

Available models:
- nerf
- license_plate
- clinical
- legal_bert
- diffusion

## Evaluation

To evaluate a trained model:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model [model_name] --checkpoint [path]
```

## Configuration

Model configurations can be found in `config/training_config.yml` and `config/preprocessing_config.yml`.

## Logging

Training logs are saved in the `logs/` directory, including:
- Training metrics
- Validation results
- Model checkpoints
- TensorBoard logs
